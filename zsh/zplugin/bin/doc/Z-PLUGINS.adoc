## z-plugins – What Are They?

They are Zplugin extensions. Note the difference in the name from the
Zplugin – the dash and the plural form.

## What Can They Do?

. Add a new Zplugin subcommand (i.e. the command that's placed after the
  function `zplugin ...` when calling Zplugin).
. Add new ice-modifiers
. Register four type of hooks:
.. `atclone` hook – run after cloning any plugin
.. `atpull` hook – run after pulling new commits (i.e. updating) for any
   plugin
.. `atinit` hook – run before loading any plugin, after it has been set-up
   (i.e. downloaded)
.. `atload` hook – run after loading any plugin
. Register hooks for generating help text, shown by the `zplugin help` subcommand

## How To Code Them?

Below is an example body of an `atclone` hook (taken from
link:https://github.com/zdharma/z-p-submods[zdharma/z-p-submods] z-plugin).
It shows how to:

. Obtain the arguments passed to the hook.
. Use an ice modifier.
. It also shows an useful snippet that will trim the whitespace in array
  elements.
. Utilize the last hook argument – the plugin's/snippet's containing
  directory.


```zsh
emulate -L zsh -o extendedglob -o warncreateglobal -o typesetsilent

[[ -z "${ZPLG_ICE[submods]}" ]] && return 0

# (1)
[[ "$1" = plugin ]] && \
    local type="$1" user="$2" plugin="$3" id_as="$4" dir="$5" || \
    local type="$1" url="$2" id_as="$3" dir="$4" # type: snippet

local -a mods parts
local mod

# (2)
mods=( ${(@s.;.)ZPLG_ICE[submods]} )
for mod in "${mods[@]}"; do
    parts=( "${(@s:->:)mod}" )
    # (3) Remove only leading and trailing whitespace
    parts=( "${parts[@]//((#s)[[:space:]]##|[[:space:]]##(#e))/}" )

    print "\nCloning submodule: ${parts[1]} to dir: ${parts[2]}"
    parts[1]="https://github.com/${parts[1]}"
    # (4) – the: -C "$dir"
    command git -C "$dir" clone --progress "${parts[1]}" "${parts[2]}"
done
```

The recommended method of creating a hook is to place its body into a file
that starts with a colon, and also a `zp-` prefix, e.g.
`:zp-myproject-atclone-hook` and then to mark it for autoloading via
`autoload -Uz :zp-myproject-atclone-hook`. Then register the hook
(presumably in the `myproject.plugin.zsh` file) with the API call:
`@zplg-register-z-plugin`:

```zsh
@zplg-register-z-plugin "myproject" hook:atclone \
    :zp-myproject-atclone-handler \
    :zp-myproject-atclone-help-handler \
    "submods''" # register a new ice-mod: submods''
```

The general syntax of the API call is:

```zsh
@zplg-register-z-plugin {project-name} \
    {hook:<hook-type>|subcommand:<new-subcommand-name>} \
    {name-of-the-handler-function} \
    {name-of-the-HELP-handler-function} \
    "{ice-mod1}|{ice-mod2}|..."
```

The last argument, i.e. the `|`-separated ice-list, is optional. That's
all! After this loading the plugin `myproject` will set up the new ice-mod
`submods` that will have syntax `submods'{user}/{plugin} –> {output-dir};
...'` and will clone submodules when installing the original plugin or
snippet! Example real-world use of the ice-mod:

```zsh
# Load the `zsh-autosuggestions' plugin via Prezto module: `autosuggestions'
zplugin ice svn submods'zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions -> external'
zplugin snippet PZT::modules/autosuggestions
```

Checkout the project which fully implements this idea,
link:https://github.com/zdharma/z-p-submods[zdharma/z-p-submods]. It e.g.
also implements the `atpull` hook, i.e. supports automatic update of the
submodules. The `z-p-*` prefix is recommended for projects that are being
z-plugins.

## Details

There are 2 or 3 subtypes for each of the hook:

. `atinit` or `!atinit` – the `!` version is ran before the `atinit`
  **ice-mod** (i.e. before `zplugin ice atinit'echo this!'; ...`), while
  the normal version runs after it.
. `atload` or `!atload` – analogous to the `atinit` case: the `!` version
  runs before the `atload` **ice-mod** (while the normal version runs after
  it).
. `atclone` or `!atclone` – analogous to the `atinit` and `atload` cases.
. `atpull`, `!atpull` or `%atpull` – the first two are being ran **only
  when there are new commits to be downloaded** during the update. The `%`
  version is being **always** run, regardless if the update will pull any
  actual commits or not, and it is being ran **after** the `atpull`
  **ice-mod**.
